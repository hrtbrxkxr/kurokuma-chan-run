### KuroKuma-chan RUN!
## About this project
Hi! ðŸ˜¸
This is my new game project called "KuroKuma-chan RUN!". It's a endless running game and this is my first unity 3D project.ðŸ’™ 
The main purpose of this project is to learning and improving my skill for 3D game. I have never created 3D game before because the project file is too big for my computer lol.ðŸ¤£  
But I think at least I should try to learning about it for improve my unity developing skill. This game might not be the best but at least I try to create it, so I'm proud of myself a little. 
I will be glad if you can tell me some suggestion to improve my skill. I just want to do better in the future! ðŸ˜¸  
Since this project's files are very big, I will upload only Scences files and Scripts files. Other files like 3D model, Environment, Fonts that not my own materials, I will give credits all below.
## How to play

In this game you will play as Kurokama-chan and run along the stage. You need to avoid the obstacles by using an arrow key (left or right). If you hit the obstacle, the game will be over! try to get some high score!
