### KuroKuma-chan RUN!
## About this project
Hi! ðŸ˜¸
This is my new game project called "KuroKuma-chan RUN!". It's a endless running game and this is my first unity 3D project.ðŸ’™ 
The main purpose of this project is to learning and improving my skill for 3D game. I have never created 3D game before because the project file is too big for my computer lol.ðŸ¤£  
But I think at least I should try to learning about it for improve my unity developing skill. This game might not be the best but at least I try to create it, so I'm proud of myself a little. 
I will be glad if you can tell me some suggestion to improve my skill. I just want to do better in the future! ðŸ˜¸  
Since this project's files are very big, I will upload only Scences files and Scripts files. Other files like 3D model, Environment, Fonts that not my own materials, I will give credits all below.
